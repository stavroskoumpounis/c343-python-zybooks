"""A guitar has 6 strings that play the notes E (lowest), A, D, G, B, and e (highest). A guitar's neck has regions
called frets. A musical chord like a "G" or "C" is a combination of notes, and can be played by pressing certain
strings at certain frets and then strumming all 6 strings. To quickly learn to play chords, people share "tabs" --
visual indications of what strings to press. To enable easy sharing over the internet, tabs are usually shared as
text files. Write a program that takes a string input representing one of three chords (G, C, D) and outputs the
corresponding tab. If the input is G, the output is:

e|-3- B|-0- G|-0- D|-0- A|-2- E|-3- 0 means to strum the string open (without pressing). 1 means to press the string
at the first fret, 2 at the second fret, 3 at the third fret.

If the input is C, the output is:

e|-0-
B|-1-
G|-0-
D|-2-
A|-3-
E|---
The - on the E string below the numbers means to not strum that string for that chord.

If the input is D, the output is:

e|-2-
B|-3-
G|-2-
D|-0-
A|---
E|---
