"""Example problem, to get you warmed up Given an input integer, output two times that integer. End with newline. (
NOTE: Nearly every problem expects the student to follow the good practice of always ending output with a newline,
so the newline won't be explicitly stated). Do not prompt the user to enter the integer; just read the integer. Ex:
If the input is 3, the output should be 6.
