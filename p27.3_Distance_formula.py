"""
Map/GPS applications commonly compute the distance between two points. A point may be a coordinate on an x-y plane
like (1.5, 2.0). The distance formula is d = âˆš((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) (basically, Pythagorean's Theorem). Given two
points, output the distance between them. If the input is (1.5, 2.0) (4.5, 6.0), the output is 5. Note: End with a
newline.
